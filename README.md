# MIDIPianoInput
Displays keys graphically via parsing MIDI input from Yamaha digital piano keyboard.

A side project originally aimed to be a 2D platform game with control based off of inputs from a Yamaha digital piano. Graphically, I am not as talented with Pygame so I decided to just create something quickly to show which keys are played at once by parsing the raw data using mido.
